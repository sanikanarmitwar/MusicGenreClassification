# MusicGenreClassification

This repository contains the code for a music genre classification project. The goal of the project is to classify music samples into different genres using machine learning techniques.

## Files

### Jupyter/Colab Notebooks

- `musicgenreAUDIO.ipynb`: notebook containing code for processing audio data and extracting features for music genre classification using only mfcc.
- `musicgenreAUDIOfinal.ipynb`: final notebook for audio data processing and feature extraction, contains mfcc + tempo, spectral bandwidth and centroid etc.
- `musicgenreCSV3.ipynb`: notebook focusing on processing CSV data related to music for classification purposes.
- `musicgenreCSV30.ipynb`: similar to `musicgenreCSV3.ipynb`, but for 3 second audio clips.
- `musicgenreIMAGEfinal.ipynb`: notebook dedicated to image-based techniques for music genre classification, spectrogram interpretation.

## Usage

Each notebook contains code and explanations for different aspects of the music genre classification project. Users can explore these notebooks to understand the data processing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation steps involved in the project.

## Dependencies

The code in the notebooks requires the following dependencies:
- Python 3.12
- Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, librosa (for audio processing), and matplotlib.
